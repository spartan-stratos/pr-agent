"""The GitLab webhook has to say how a comment command ended, in reactions on that comment.

The GitHub App handler already does this; the GitLab webhook only added the start reaction, so
`reaction_on_success` and `reaction_on_failure` did nothing there. The interesting part is not the
extra call but the verdict: `propagate_tool_errors` is off, so a tool that fails internally still
returns normally, and reacting as if it had succeeded would tick a comment whose command never
ran. `command_failed()` is the signal that does not change how the tool handles its own error.

Both outcome reactions default to empty, so this path is inert until an operator configures one;
`test_the_shipped_defaults_ask_for_no_outcome_reaction` below pins that.
